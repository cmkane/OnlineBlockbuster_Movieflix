Online Blockbuster: MovieFlix

This web applications project includes both the front end and back end of a online blockbuster
store. In this store a user can buy movies by adding them to their cart etc.
This is an example project that uses PayPal API sandbox to simulate the buying
of movies.

To setup the backend java server I used REST API with Jersey and Grizzly.
The front end was written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

List of Backend Services:
 - Gateway
 - IDM
 - Movie
 - Billing
